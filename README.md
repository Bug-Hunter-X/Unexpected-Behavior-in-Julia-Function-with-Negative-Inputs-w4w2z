# Julia Function Bug
This repository demonstrates a bug in a simple Julia function that handles negative numbers unexpectedly. The function is designed to return the square of the input, regardless of its sign, but it produces an incorrect result for negative inputs.
The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a corrected version of the function.
